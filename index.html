<hr><h1>Overview:</h1>

<p>tIDE is an Integrated Development Environment written for t, a fictional programming language designed by my CTI lecturer. As part of the assignment for the course, I was required to write an assembler, disassembler and virtual machine (All as separate components) for the t-language. I took it a step further and wrote an editor, at the same time integrating all of the individual components into a single program. tIDE allows for assembly, execution and disassembly of t programs from one location, and has a host of nifty features to boot. As an added note, this is the largest project I have worked with to date, with close to 40 classes.</p>

<p>Notes:
Parts of the assembler were written by my lecturer, Graham Barbour. This program also makes use of (A heavily modified version of) JEdit's <a href="http://www.jedit.org/api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html">JEditTextArea</a> for the editor component, which was written by Slava Pestov. JEditTextArea is freely modifiable and distributable.</p>
