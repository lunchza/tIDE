As part of the assignment for the course, I was required to write an assembler, disassembler and virtual machine (All as separate components) for the t-language. I took it a step further and wrote an editor, at the same time integrating all of the individual components into a single program. tIDE allows for assembly, execution and disassembly of t programs from one location, and has a host of nifty features to boot. As an added note, this is the largest project I have worked with to date, with close to 40 classes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nParts of the assembler were written by my lecturer, Graham Barbour. This program also makes use of (A heavily modified version of) JEdit's [JEditTextArea](http://www.jedit.org/api/org/gjt/sp/jedit/textarea/JEditTextArea.html) for the editor component, which was written by Slava Pestov. JEditTextArea is freely modifiable and distributable.\r\n\r\n# Feature List:\r\n* Fully Integrated IDE for t-language\r\n* Syntax and error highlighting\r\n* Hand-written 2-pass assembler\r\n* Virtual Machine based on the Von-Neumann architecture","name":"tIDE"}
